    A user named chursch submitted some modifications to rs22812.py
    that he used to get things working on Linux.  I haven't tried or
    tested this file, so you'll want to read the code first before
    using it.

    Plot of some data taken with the Radio Shack meter in 2002.  The
    measured values were a thermocouple's voltage which were
    translated into temperature.  The oven is a GE oven installed in
    our house in 1971.  0.1 mV resolution of Radio Shack meter means
    temperature resolution of about 5 deg F.  The thermocouple joint
    was put into about the middle of the oven, suspended in air.
    Here's the timeline:

    7:33 pm:    Turned the oven to 200 F
    7:47 pm:    Set oven to 300 F
    8:33 pm:    Set oven to 400 F
    9:21 pm:    Set oven to 500 F
    9:39 pm:    Turned oven off
